I (Emily) am a former elementary teacher, stay-at-home mom, and high school secretary, and recently retired to be at home full time. Jeff has retired from his 30+ year career as a mechanical engineer, but continues to work from home part time as a consultant. Our favorite work is now that of sheep farmers!</p><p>We purchased our farm, which was a former 9-hole golf course, in 2017. After many updates to the farmhouse, our son and his wife lived here for a few years. In June of 2020, Jeff and I moved to the farm after they moved to a house in town. We continued to work on the property, including having a permanent perimeter fence installed around the majority of the 33 acres in June 2021. </p><p>The Katahdin sheep breed is one that was developed in the 1950’s by Michael Piel, a sheep farmer and amateur geneticist, near Mount Katahdin, the highest mountain in Maine (also known as the northern terminus of the Appalachian Trail). Katahdins are medium-sized, with ewes weighing 120 to 160 pounds and rams weighing 180 to 250 pounds. It is a hair sheep that sheds its hair coat, not needing to be sheared like a wool sheep. It also is a meat breed, adapts well to different climates, and is more resistant to parasite infections. Katahdin ewes have good mothering skills and usually lamb easily, with lambs being born vigorous and alert. The breed is ideal for pasture lambing and grass/forage-based management systems. To learn more about the breed, visit this Katahdin FAQ page at this <a class="our-story-link" href="https://www.baalands.com/katahdinfaqs" target="_blank">link</a></p><p>In July 2021, we purchased our starter flock of 20 Katahdin ewes and a livestock guardian dog, who were all born on the same farm at approximately the same time, on pasture in Feb/Mar 2021. The dog had only known being with sheep and they were used to her being around. Once they arrived on our farm, we started moving them daily, from paddock to paddock, with them being fenced in an area with temporary fence posts, strung with 3 strands of polybraid (we now only use 2 strands), which was electrified using a clip that connected to the hot wire atop our perimeter fence. </p><p>Our first few days were quite an experience as we learned, for the first time in our life, how to work with livestock. We are very grateful no one took video (that we are aware of) of that first pasture move! If only we had known the #1 rule of working with sheep – Never chase sheep! Since that time, we have learned a great deal more and the sheep have come to know us as their shepherds and they know our voices. All we have to do now when we want to move them is walk to the corner of the paddock and either clap our hands or call, ‘Sheep! Sheep!’ and they come running – if they haven’t already come when we started opening up a gate to the next paddock. </p><p>We added our first registered Katahdin ram at Thanksgiving that fall and, in April and May 2022, 18 lambs were born. Of those, we kept 6 ewe lambs. The others were sold as breeding stock or meat or added to our own freezer. We also purchased 6 additional ewe lambs and another livestock guardian dog (this time a male) from the same farmer of our original flock. We also purchased an additional registered Katahdin ram later that fall. </p><p>In April/May 2023, we had 25 ewes give birth to 42 lambs! We have kept 5 of those ewe lambs to bring our breeding ewes to a total of 31, after culling some of the ewes, and losing 1 due to a prolapse and another to pneumonia. We are looking forward to April and May 2024, our 3rd lambing season! </p><p>We plan to keep a breeding flock of around 30 ewes. We will sell our lambs either as commercial breeding stock, or to those that want to finish them before butchering, or as meat cuts, either to sell or for our own use. </p></div></div></div><div class="accordion-item"><h2 class="accordion-header" id="flush-headingTwo"><button class="accordion-button collapsed" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#flush-collapseTwo" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="flush-collapseTwo"> Our Farming Methods </button></h2><div id="flush-collapseTwo" class="accordion-collapse collapse" aria-labelledby="flush-headingTwo" data-bs-parent="#accordionFlushExample"><div class="accordion-body"><p>Our sheep are born and raised on pasture – we have no barn to bring them into. They have shade wagons and trees for shade in the summer and fall and we provide windbreaks/shelter during cold, windy winter days – not that the sheep take advantage of them.</p><p>We practice Management Intensive Grazing. This is where we break up our entire pasture areas into smaller ½- to 1-acre paddocks with temporary fencing which is electrified by being connected to the electrified high tensile wire atop the woven wire perimeter fence. We move the sheep every day or two, depending on the amount of forage available. With these moves, we also have to move their shade wagons, if there are no trees in the paddock, and their water supply. This creates a great deal more work for us as farmers rather than having them in a large pasture for weeks at a time. </p><p>Why have we chosen to manage our farm this way? What are the benefits? It not only helps improve our pastures, but helps keep our sheep healthy. How? I’ll give the best answer that my 3 years of farming experience has given me! </p><p>Only having the sheep graze in a small area for a short time allows them to eat down the forage in the paddock, but not to the ground. Just eating off the top few inches of the forage leaves enough of the plant to regrow and remain strong. This keeps the plants healthier. When plants are grazed too low, other less desirable plants may block the sun and keep them from growing back as easily. Also, when plants get eaten really short, their roots suffer, causing the plants not to thrive. </p><p>Another benefit from being in smaller areas is that the animal manure and urine is more evenly distributed over the entire property. The soil quality and fertility will greatly improve with the addition of natural fertilizer. If they were in a large pasture, the animals would tend to only look for their favorite plants to eat and would eat those to the ground and their manure and urine would only be located near those favorite areas. When they are in a smaller paddock, while they may go eat the clover patches first (our sheep’s favorite), they will start grazing other plants since there isn’t as much clover in each smaller paddock. They will graze from one end of a paddock to the other leaving their fertilizer along the way, not just from clump to clump here or there.</p><p>Rotational grazing also helps with internal parasites. Sheep and goats are susceptible to internal parasites. The parasite larva that can cause illnesses in sheep live near the ground and can only travel up grasses a couple of inches. If we move the sheep into a paddock that has 8” tall grasses/forage, and they only eat it down a couple of inches, the hope is that they won’t ingest the parasites. While most sheep do always have some internal parasites in their digestive system (these are not in the meat of the animal), many have become more resistant to parasite infections. The parasites are still present, but that animal’s immune system can better withstand the infections. Those animals will still shed some parasite eggs in their manure, which will hatch into larva in just a few days. If we move our flock from that area before they hatch in 3-5 days, the larva will only live a few weeks without a host and their life-cycle will be broken since our flock won’t be grazing that area again for 30 days or more. </p><p>Even with precautions taken, some sheep may still get an infection from the parasite. While some farms choose to treat their entire flocks on a scheduled basis for parasites to avoid illness, we have chosen to only treat those that show symptoms/signs of infection. Many deworming medicines have become ineffective because the parasites have developed a resistance to them. Along these lines, if we have a sheep that has to be treated for parasite infection more often than the majority of the flock, that sheep is culled. We only want to keep sheep that have the stronger resistance to parasites and have them pass that trait on to their offspring.</p><p>Our sheep are 100% grass and hay fed – no grain. Many farmers choose to finish their livestock on grain, they feel it gives the meat better marbling. We have chosen, though, to not feed grain. Sheep and other ruminants weren’t designed to eat grain, just to forage grasses, forbs, and legumes. Grassfed and grass finished meat is leaner, has higher levels of Omega 3 fatty acids, and is more nutrient dense. </p><p>We do not use antibiotics or other medications for growth promotion. We will, though, use an antibiotic to help a sick animal if needed. We aim to take the best care of these animals we own and don’t want them to suffer. Despite our best practices, some animals, just like people, get sick. If we do treat an animal with medication and the animal still needs to be culled from our flock, we will follow the recommended meat withdrawal period before having the animal butchered for meat. </p></div></div></div><div class="accordion-item"><h2 class="accordion-header" id="flush-headingThree"><button class="accordion-button collapsed" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#flush-collapseThree" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="flush-collapseThree"> Why Eat Lamb? </button></h2><div id="flush-collapseThree" class="accordion-collapse collapse" aria-labelledby="flush-headingThree" data-bs-parent="#accordionFlushExample"><div class="accordion-body"><p>The best answer to that question is easy – IT’S DELICIOUS! </p><p> Many people we speak to say they don’t eat lamb and sometimes mention they don’t like the gamey taste in the lamb meat. Something that causes that taste is the lanolin that is present in wool sheep. Katahdin sheep are hair sheep, not wool, so they do not produce the amount of lanolin that wool sheep do, thus no strong flavor. Our 100% grass-fed lamb is very mild and tender. </p><p>Lamb meat, which comes from sheep that are in their first year (mutton is the word for meat from a sheep that is a year or older), is a very healthy red meat. </p><p>Health benefits:<br>   1) Lamb is an excellent source of iron.<br>   2) It is a nervous system health promoter, containing excellent levels of different B vitamins<br>   3) It is loaded with zinc – an immune booster<br>   4) It is a rich source of healthy fats like omega-3 &amp; CLA<br>   5) It is a great source of protein </p><p>For more details about these health benefits visit this <a class="our-story-link" href="https://draxe.com/nutrition/lamb-meat/" target="_blank">link</a></p><img src="'+d+'"></div></div></div><div class="accordion-item"><h2 class="accordion-header" id="flush-headingFour"><button class="accordion-button collapsed" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#flush-collapseFour" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="flush-collapseFour"> The Farm Staff </button></h2><div id="flush-collapseFour" class="accordion-collapse collapse" aria-labelledby="flush-headingFour" data-bs-parent="#accordionFlushExample"><div class="accordion-body"><h2>Our Current Ewe Crew</h2><p>We currently have 31 ewes/ewe lambs that we are using as our breeding stock. Our original flock is our green-tagged girls. Our ewes born here or purchased in 2022 are the yellow tags. Our ewes with orange tags were born on our farm in 2023. Tags are used to identify each animal and help us keep good health records. While we can look at many of the sheep and tell you exactly which sheep it is, many of them are just plain white and more difficult to identify. </p><p>Sheep are quite stand-offish. They have no means of protection except to flee, so they stay back from us. They have gotten more familiar with us over the years, but still will jump back and usually not let us easily touch them. The exceptions, though, are the bottle babies, ones we had to bottle feed several times a day for a couple of months because their mommas rejected them. Also, some of the sheep we have treated for illness became more comfortable with us and will nuzzle us or allow us to rub their necks or side.</p><p>In spring 2022, our 20 ewes gave us 18 lambs, with 4 of the ewes not giving birth. There were 14 singles and 2 sets of twins. In spring 2023, 25 ewes gave birth to 42 lambs. We had 11 singles, 11 sets of twins, and 3 sets of triplets born. Katahdins usually give birth to twins or triplets after their first lambing. </p><h2><strong>The Green Team – born Spring 2021</strong></h2><p><strong>Green 1 – Fuzzy Freckles</strong> – Named for her freckled nose and her winter hair coat that is fuzzier than the normal coat. In 2022 she had twins, rejecting the ram lamb who was named King Ralphie who was a beloved bottle baby. He became a wether on a friend’s farm. </p><p><strong>Green 2 – Lipstick</strong> – She is named because of her black lips. The rest of her is plain white. She doesn’t seem to be afraid of us as much as others and will come closer to us. She doesn’t shed her winter hair completely, usually is still walking around with a ‘collar’ and ‘tutu’ of hair in July. Our daughter Mary will trim her up to help her stay cool</p><p><strong>Green 3 – Blackie</strong> – She is named for the black undersides of her ears and belly – color traits from a Blackbelly sheep that is in her genetics. She has crazy-looking black eyebrows! She has a beautiful shape. </p><p><strong>Green 4 – Flopsy</strong> – She is a plain white ewe who didn’t have a name the first year or so, until after she got her ear tag. We must’ve hit the wrong spot, because that ear has been bent down since soon after she was tagged, thus the name Flopsy. </p><p><strong>Green 5 – No Name</strong> – She is a plain white ewe. Very good mom and milk provider</p><p><strong>Green 7 – Creamy</strong> – Creamy is a light cream color. She has long legs but not as bulky as the other ewes. She is friendlier than most and will approach us for neck rubs. </p><p><strong>Green 8 – Patches (the OG)</strong> – She is white with reddish brown patches. </p><p><strong>Green 10 – Mocha</strong> – Mocha is a tan color, darker than Creamy, and has a white face.</p><p><strong>Green 11 – Chocolate</strong> – Chocolate is a very dark brown with a black face that has a tiny white spot on her forehead. She has really thick hair in winter that fades by spring. Her build is on the smaller side. She doesn’t slick off in the summer very well and we cut off the remaining hunks to cool her down. She gave us twins her first two year, rejecting one of them the first year – our bottle baby Millie, who is Yellow 2. </p><p><strong>Green 12 – Slick</strong> – She is one of our larger white ewes that we only could distinguish her because she had really slick hair.</p><p><strong>Green 13 – Patty the Pirate</strong> – She was given this name for two reasons. One, she is all white with a reddish brown patch over her left eye. The other was because she kept trying to steal another ewe’s lamb the first year. At first, we couldn’t figure out why she was so persistent to take another’s lamb. Then we discovered, at least 12 hours after it was born (we were in the pasture all day watching everyone), a lamb on the other half of our farm, walking up a hill. We figured this must be her lamb that she knew she had given birth to, that must’ve gone under a fence in the dark. Patty would not accept it, it no longer smelled like her, so this strong little lamb became our first bottle baby and my most favorite sheep – Pumpkin Pie – yellow 1. </p><p><strong>Green 14 – Maxine</strong> – She is one of our largest ewes, solid white. We only know who she is when we see her tag. She was given the name Maxine after the lamb she had in Spring 2022. He was a HUGE lamb, was born 4 weeks after the rest of the flock lambed. We had to have the vet come because her birth was not progressing. The vet ended up pulling this seemingly half-grown lamb and we thought it was dead, but a few seconds after it hit the ground, it started breathing. Jeff named him ‘Miracle Max’ after the character in the movie The Princess Bride who said something like, ‘There&#39;s a big difference between mostly dead and all dead. Mostly dead is slightly alive.’ This lamb had been mostly dead. We gave her the name Maxine after her son left our farm. </p><p><strong>Green 15 – Not Fuzzy Freckles</strong> – She really has no name, but this is what she gets called often because she looks very similar to Green 1 and then we see she doesn’t have a tag. Once we tag the next batch of lambs she will become Green 19 because she lost her tag somewhere.</p><p><strong>Green 17 – Deer</strong> - I gave her this name when she was new to our farm – she was very dainty looking, like a deer. She has a reddish patch on the right side of her neck. </p><p><strong>Green 18 – No Name</strong> – She is our biggest ewe, plain white.</p><h2><strong>The Yellow Team – Born Spring 2022</strong></h2><p><strong>Yellow 1 – Pumpkin Pie</strong> – (born on our farm – Green 13/Patty the Pirate is her momma) -Our first bottle baby, named for her colors – white with reddish and creamy spots. See Green 13 Patty the Pirate for her birth story. Pumpkin is a strong individual, a loner – comes from her first day of life. She will happily graze away from everyone else, keeps to the edges, right under the electric wire fence where everyone else is afraid to graze but where there is a lot of choice forage! Pumpkin will let us pet her, comes to us right away when we come out to their paddock, jumps on Jeff’s back if he is too slow in putting hay in the feeder. MY FAVORITE! </p><p><strong>Yellow 2 – Millie</strong> – (born on our farm – Green 11/Chocolate is her Momma) Our second bottle baby, named by our daughter Mary whose birthday she was born on. My next favorite!</p><p><strong>Yellow 4 – No Name</strong> – (born on our farm – Green 5 is her momma) plain white</p><p><strong>Yellow 5 – Ralphie’s Sister</strong> – (born on our farm – Green 1/Fuzzy Freckles is her momma) She is white with a small reddish spot on the left side of her back, the exact same as the spot as Meatball the ram who is her dad. She was a twin, her brother was a bottle baby named Ralphie. </p><p><strong>Yellow 6 – Spot</strong> – She is white with a big red spot on her right hip</p><p><strong>Yellow 7 – Snuffleupagus</strong> – (born on our farm – Green 3/Blackie is her momma) Jeff gave her this name because she has a red tail and red color on either side of her tail (otherwise she is white) that reminds him of the Muppet character, Mr. Snuffleupagus. </p><p><strong>Yellow 15 – No name</strong> – plain white</p><p><strong>Yellow 170/166</strong> (the tag has one number on top, another on the bottom) – white with freckles</p><p><strong>Yellow 254 – Silverbutt</strong> – This ewe is reddish, but the hair above her tail/butt is fuzzier and fades to white partway through winter, thus the name.</p><p><strong>Yellow 320 – PJ</strong> (Patches Junior – although she isn’t Patches’ baby) She is white with the red/brown patches all over, more spots than Patches has. PJ is very friendly, comes up first when we come out to work, will let us pet her. She likes to eat the dog’s food. Ugh.</p><p><strong>Yellow 325 – Molasses</strong> (Mo for short) – This ewe is reddish, has white spots on her head. </p><h2><strong>The Orange Team – Born Spring 2023</strong></h2><p><strong>Orange 1 – Cutie Pie</strong>- (Yellow 1/Pumpkin Pie is her momma) She is white with a few spots, but, most importantly, she has a heart-shaped red spot on her left hip. Her ears are creamy color. She is precious. </p><p><strong>Orange 2 – Lil Bit</strong> (Green 1/Fuzzy Freckles is her momma) She was a triplet, smaller in size but she is getting big</p><p><strong>Orange 3 – Ralphie’s Niece (RN)</strong> (Yellow 5/Ralphie’s Sister is her momma)</p><p><strong>Orange 4 – Red</strong> (Yellow 254/Silverbutt is her momma)</p><p><strong>Orange 5 – Blaze</strong> – (Green 14/Maxine is her momma) If she isn’t happy with us, she will stomp her foot at us. It’s hilarious! (Might be scary when she is 140lbs+) </p><h2><strong>The Boys</strong></h2><p><strong>Meatball – Registered Katahdin ram – OXB2165</strong> - Breeder Oxberry Farm, Medina, OH – born spring 2021 <br>     Meatball is used to breed our Green-tagged ewes and will also be used for any of the Orange-tagged ewes that Hoagie sired. <br>     Meatball is friendly, he often comes frolicking across the paddock to get his neck rubbed by Jeff. He is nearly 200 pounds, so it’s pretty funny to see. </p><p><strong>Hoagie – Registered Katahdin ram – MOF2216</strong> – Breeder Misty Oaks Farm, Wooster, OH – born spring 2022 <br>     Hoagie is used to breed our Yellow-tagged ewes. <br>     Hoagie’s behavior was fine his first year during breeding. Not so much this year. He gets aggressive when with the ewes and will run at and ram Jeff. He knocked Jeff to the ground once. Because of this we will not have him in our flock much longer. He is calmer now that no ewes are in estrus, but occasionally he feels the need to run at Jeff. It’s difficult to care for the animals when you always have to be watching out for a ram. I don’t go in with the rams very often at all. I’m too afraid. </p><p><strong>Burrito – castrated wether – MOF2162</strong> – Breeder Oxberry Farm, Medina, OH – born spring 2021 <br>     Burrito was purchased to be a friend to Meatball. When the ewes are no longer breeding and it is time for lambing, we take the rams out into a separate area. Because sheep are flock animals, they need another one with them. Meatball and Burrito came from the same farm. Also, if you just had 2 rams, they would fight a great deal more for dominance, until the pecking order is set. </p><h2><strong>Livestock Guardian Dogs</strong></h2><p><strong>Livestock Guardian Dogs (LGDs) </strong> are used for protection, not herding. We have 2 LGDs, one is a Great Pyrenees/Anatolian Shepherd mix (Lucky, our female) and the other is a Great Pyrenees/Anatolian Shepherd/Bernese Mountain dog mix (Rocky, our male). </p><p><strong>Lucky</strong> – Lucky was born in spring 2021 on the same farm as our green-tagged ewes. She was born and raised on pasture just like the lambs and knows nothing but being with the sheep. She was given her name because of the circumstances involving her delivery to our farm. She was in a separate part of the trailer that was bringing the 20 ewe lambs and her north on Interstate 65 from Kentucky. She can be a nervous dog and was in a different environment and was not with her sheep friends. Somehow, she managed to open the side door of the trailer, as it was traveling at 65mph, and jumped. The driver happened to look in his side mirror at that exact moment. He was able to pull off to the side of the road, traffic around him slowed. He was able to catch the dog and carry her 1/10 mile back to the truck. When he handed her to us, he told us what happened. We took her to the vet who checked her over and then had x-rays taken. Besides a few scuffs and holding her back leg up for a few days, she had no injuries. Because of this, we named her Lucky, short for Lucky to be Alive after that Death Defying Stunt!</p><p>It didn’t take her long to show us what she is meant to do, which is to protect our flock from outsiders. When we open a new paddock, she is the first to run in and will run to the opposite side, and usually all the way around, leaving her scent. If there are small critters in that paddock, she either chases them off or gets rid of them. While she doesn’t bark as much as she did when she first arrived, she will bark at things she doesn’t like (like the sound of the neighbor rolling his trashcan down to the road) or things she feels are threats to the safety of the flock. Her breed will attack any threats that enter the paddock, but they work first just to try to scare things off with their barking. She definitely has a warning bark and an ‘I mean business’ bark. If she feels that the sheep could be threatened, she will run back to the flock, barking at them, and pushing them into a small group, away from the threat. The sheep have learned, too, that if she gets a specific bark, that they need to move away from where she is and bunch up. If a sheep (usually Pumpkin Pie) doesn’t move back, she will run at it and make it move, then runs back to where the threat is. Lucky still is a bit stand-offish and only comes to us when she wants to (makes it very difficult to put hands on her when we need to take her to the vet). She WILL come to us when there is thunder, when really loud guns are being shot nearby, or fireworks. We will take advantage of those times and brush out her coat. The first lambing season she experienced was an interesting one. We don’t know if she thought the lambs were a threat or if she was just trying to help the moms clean up. Whatever it was, we sat out during the lambings and made sure she stayed away from the moms and babies. If a mom didn’t clean up the afterbirth (it’s full of nutrients) we allowed Lucky to clean it up. Otherwise, the scent could attract predators. She was fantastic during the second year, didn’t really care what was going on and she didn’t play with the lambs or chase them, even when they would run over her as she was lying in the field. </p><p><strong>Rocky</strong> – Rocky was born on the same farm as Lucky and we purchased him in the summer of 2022 when we purchased 6 additional ewes. This time, though, Jeff picked up the sheep and dog in our trailer, putting the dog in the truck with him. From the first day we had him, Jeff would joke, ‘Better not love on him too much, or you’ll make him a pet!’ He is a great mix of a guardian dog and sweet boy! He loves to dance with Jeff, with his paws on Jeff’s shoulders. He is a big dog! He did like to play with the sheep, though, as a puppy. He would run after them and nip at their tails, which would be flopping in his face. We tried several techniques to keep that from happening, but ended up putting him on a lead inside a paddock, where he could be with the sheep, but they could get away. Now, we mostly only have him with the big boys. The only time we have a problem is when Hoagie tries to eat Rocky’s food and Rocky will nip at him. He has a ferocious bark and uses it quite often when the neighbor comes to pick up his mail. We no longer allow him to be in a paddock right next to the road so he won’t worry the neighbor or chase cyclists or cars. If there is a threat, he could easily jump the interior fence and get to the perimeter. He probably could easily jump perimeter fence, too, but he put his paws up there once and got shocked by the electric wire at the top and cried like a baby for quite some time! (I do, too! It’s no fun to get zapped!) Both dogs have a great respect for all of our fencing, which is good (both their respect AND our fences!). We have heard of many farmers that have troubles keeping their Great Pyrenees from wandering the countryside, chasing predators. Hopefully, our dogs’ behavior won’t change. </p></div></div></div></div></div></article></main>',1),f={__name:"AboutView",setup(p){return(m,u)=>(r(),t(a,null,[e(s),c,e(i)],64))}};export{f as default};
